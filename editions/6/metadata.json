This is the fourth in the collection, for those who walk alone into the unknown. The Warrior is equipped with wisdom as their weapon.\n\nBased on the Ethernal hero classes, we are releasing a total of 5 artworks: a new limited artwork every 14 days. Each artwork will have a maximum of 20 art tokens.\n\nEach token comes with: High-resolution JPEG and animated GIF files + Original sketch + Mobile wallpapers. Collect all five tokens to receive special high-resolution JPEG and animated GIF files with all the heroes in portrait and landscape views.\n\nAfter you purchase the art token, email enter@ethernal.world with the address that owns the token to receive the bundle.",
